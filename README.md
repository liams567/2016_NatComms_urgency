### Contents

* CAF_fitting: Matlab functions to fit a piece-wise logistic conditional accuracy function to single-trial accuracy and response time data (e.g. as in panel c of [Figure 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13526/figures/1) in paper). Top-level function is `fit_CAF.m`.

* DDM_reg: Matlab functions to fit the 'regular' drift diffusion model (with static bounds) to choice/response time data (e.g. as in panels f-i of [Figure 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13526/figures/3) in paper). Top-level function is `FIT_regular_DDM_PSO.m`. Optimization performed via particle swarm optimization ([Birge, 2003](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1202265)). N.B. fitting approach matches the approach used to fit model with time-dependent urgency (see below); as such it differs in some respects to typical DDM fitting routines (e.g. it estimates first passage time densities at relatively sparse intervals and interpolates). If only regular DDM needs to be fit, other approaches are strongly recommended (e.g. HDDM; [Wiecki, Sofer & Frank, 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2013.00014/full)). 

* DDM_urg: Matlab functions to fit drift diffusion model with time-dependent urgency (equivalent to collapsing bounds) (e.g. as in panels a-e of [Figure 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13526/figures/3) in paper). Top-level function is `FIT_urgency_DDM_PSO.m`. Method for estimating first passage time densities is based on [Smith (2000)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022249699912609) and [Zhang et al. (2014)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01364/full).

* LCA_modeling: example Matlab functions to fit two-alternative leaky competing accumulator model with time-dependent gain modulation to choice/response time data (e.g. as in [Figure 6](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13526/figures/6) in paper). Top-level function is `FIT_LCA_model_FR.m`. In this example, the effective time constant of the accumulators (determined by a combination of leak, recurrent excitation and lateral inhibition) is set to match the time constant estimated in [Carland et al. (2016)](https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00264.2015) (see paper for motivation). Code can easily be adapted to vary these parameters independently. Example code also only fits to one experimental condition.
